-----------------

This application is a C++ implementation of three Strongly Connected Compoment's algorithms (Gabow, Kosaraju and Tarjan) in C++.
The objective is to compare these algorithms depending the implementation of Graph structure choosen (Matrix or List of adjacency) when the number of arcs vary.

## How to compile

Go inside the **cmake-build-release**, execute **make** command then launch the **graphes** executable generated.

## Benchmark Graphs

If you want to launch the benchmarks for the differents algorithms and automaticaly generate graphs, you can launch the **run.sh** script at the project's root directory.

## Context 

This project was written in French for a French class about graph theory.
If you understand French, you can read the rapport <a href="Rapport_Theorie_des_Graphes.pdf">here</a>.
